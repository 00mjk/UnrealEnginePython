# Snippets for Static and Skeletal Meshes

This is a collection of snippets/examples for StaticMeshes and SkeletalMeshes manipulation/creation.

Operations on animations, morph targets and LODs are included too

## Introduction

Before starting with snippets, we should introduce some convention:

Each script (unless differently specified) should be run manually from the console or the embedded python editor, and will be executed to the currently selected objects in the content browser or the world outliner.

To access the currently selected assets you use the following functions (it returns a list of UObjects):

```python
import unreal_engine as ue
uobjects = ue.get_selected_assets()
```

To access the currently selected actors in the editor world outliner:

```python
actors = ue.editor_get_selected_actors()
```

This is a screenshot of getting the name of the selected assets using python list comprehension:
