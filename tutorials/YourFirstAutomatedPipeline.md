Your First Automated Pipeline with UnrealEnginePython
=

In this tutorial i will try to show how you can build a python script that can generate
a new Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint implementing a Kaiju (a big Japanese monster) with its materials, animations and a simple sensing AI.

Running the script from the Unreal Engine Python Console will result in a native Blueprint that does not require the python plugin
to work.

Technically i am showing the "editor scripting" features of the plugin, not its "gameplay scripting" mode.
